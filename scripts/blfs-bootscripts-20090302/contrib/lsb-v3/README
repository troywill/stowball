Thes scripts require the lsb-v3 scripts included in lfs-bootscripts from
current LFS SVN.  See the README file there for more information.

Currently, only about half of the BLFS scripts are included here and
dependency information is not guaranteed to be accurate on the initial
commit.  The operation of the scripts, however, should be good.  If you have
the time, please do send corrections, changes, additions, patches, etc.
my way.

Thanks.
